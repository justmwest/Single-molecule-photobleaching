# Single-molecule-photobleaching
Files used in the analysis of single-molecule TIRF microscopy data.

Notes:
- The files in this repository assume a specific directory architecture:
    date data collected > slide number (usually an experimental condition) > movie number

- The single molecule spots are automatically selected and exported by another software (IDL) prior to this analysis
